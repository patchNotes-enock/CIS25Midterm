pt1area.cpp
  -a user inputs two values for the length and width of a rectangle. THese values are then multiplied together and the product is displayed.

pt1prime.cpp
  -a user is asked to input an integer. Using a bool, the number will return a true value by default. By using a for loop that iterates from 2 to the     entered value and checks for any remainders using the modulo operator, we can then determine if the value is divisible by any other numbers which       will then return the value as false.

pt2even50.cpp
  -using a for loop that iterates from i = 1 to i = 25 and increases incrementally by 1, we can print i multipled by 2, thus giving us all even numbers   from 1-50.

pt2array.cpp
  -this function uses a while loop to request ten inputs from the user that then populate each location in the array incrementally by 1. The function     then prints the array in order.

pt3cin.cpp
  -this function declares a string and two int variables to request user input for their name, age, and favorite number. The function will print the      information next.

pt3variable.cpp
  -This function declares four types of variables (int, float, char, string) and initializes them on a separate line. the int is the number 7, the        float is 21.7, i named the char variable grade so it returns the value of A, and the string variable is the statement "RIP MF DOOM". These variables    are then printed.

pt4largest.cpp
  -the user is asked to enter three integers and the function determines which is the largest value by comparing the first value to values 2 & 3, then    comparing value 2 to value 3 if value 1 is less than value 2.

pt4leap.cpp
  -The user inputs a value representing a year, then determines if it is a leap year by cycling thru scenarios in an if/else statement. If the year is divisible by 100 and divisible by 400, it is a leap year and will output "YES!", but if it is divisible by 100 but not 400, then it is not a leap year and will output "NO!". All other years are checked to see if they are divisible by 4, which will output "YES!".
